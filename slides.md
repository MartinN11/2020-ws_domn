Digital ownership is the 

_"abillity to acces the information and knowledge of physically owned objects at any time, anywhere and use them and control the access of other users to it"_ 

(Kusper, 2014)

* Can grant or revoke rights on this data
* Helps to gain control on huge data
* Sum of data = digital treasure
* Layer of IoT: Easily accessing information about own objects is challenging -> IoT infrastructure has not been built yet
* In the information society digital ownership is a natural basic right

### 5. What does it mean to work for a Company that values Ownership?

_"Ownership means I have an obligation to the organization in terms of results, and that I have an obligation to act on the items that impact those results. I may have to assemble a team to help me bring about results, but ultimately, I must be accountable and own the results of my actions."_

(Wilms, 2017)

### 7. Problems of Ownership

   * Apple Permission Issues 
* Permission errors usually associated with Linux and MacOS installations 
* Files and directories have three operation privileges available: read Â®, write (w) and execute (x)
* System user can perform different operations depending on their operation privileges and the groups this user belongs to

---

### 7. Problems of Ownership

* Permission issue occurs when an application (or system user) is performing unauthorized operation in the filesystem
* GibHub example -> Microsoft program causes problems when used on MacOS
