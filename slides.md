### 5. What does it mean to work for a Company that values Ownership?

_"Ownership means I have an obligation to the organization in terms of results, and that I have an obligation to act on the items that impact those results. I may have to assemble a team to help me bring about results, but ultimately, I must be accountable and own the results of my actions."_

(Wilms, 2017)

### 7. Problems of Ownership

_"Data has become ever more important for businesses, yet the issue of who owns it has become equally more difficult to determine."_

(Williamson, 2018)

### 7. Problems of Ownership

> Example: automobile drivertrain with complex softwares

_Who owns the data being generated – the driver, the dealer, the OEM or the supplier?_

---

### 7. Problems of Ownership 

_"A question about data ownership on its own is too simplistic. A better question would be, who can most benefit from owning that data? In the case of the drivetrain, you would ultimately expect that to probably be the dealer and the manufacturer."_

(Williamson, 2018)
